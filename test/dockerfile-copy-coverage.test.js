// Guard: the Dockerfile must place every file the A2A server entrypoint reaches
// through its relative import graph at the exact path it is imported from inside
// the image.
//
// Why this exists (issues #15, #19): Docker never resolves JavaScript imports, so
// a COPY set that omits a needed source — or lands it at the wrong destination —
// still builds cleanly. The fault only surfaces when Node tries to resolve the
// module at boot and the container exits. That is how PR #14 shipped a server
// that imported `../skills/catalogue.js` while the Dockerfile copied only
// `src/a2a`, `src/roles`, and `assets/roles` (#15, a missing *source*); a mistyped
// *destination* (`COPY src/skills ./src/WRONGDEST`) is the same boot failure via a
// different typo (#19). Nothing in CI builds and runs the image (no Docker daemon
// on the runners — infrastructure/development#508), so this guard is the only line
// of defence for both classes.
//
// The earlier version of this guard matched COPY *source* strings only, so it was
// blind to wrong destinations: the source was still listed, so it stayed green
// while the image was broken. This version models each COPY's source -> destination
// mapping (applying WORKDIR) the way Docker's builder does, then resolves the
// entrypoint's import graph against the resulting *in-image* paths. An imported
// file is "covered" only when some COPY actually produces it at the path it is
// imported from — which catches missing sources and wrong destinations alike.
//
// Node builtins (`node:*`) and bare package specifiers are out of scope — only
// relative imports can be missing from the image. Runtime data directories read
// via `fs` (assets/roles, skills/) are not imports and are intentionally NOT
// checked here; they are covered by their own COPY lines.
