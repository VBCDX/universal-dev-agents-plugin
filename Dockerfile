# A2A cards server (issue #5).
#
# Publishes the public A2A agent cards over HTTP. The server has ZERO runtime
# dependencies — it uses only the Node built-in http module plus the committed
# role assets — so there is no npm install step and no package registry is
# contacted at build time. It needs no credentials of any kind; none are copied
# into the image, set in ENV, or present in any layer.
#
# Base pinned by explicit version AND digest (Node 22 LTS on Alpine).
